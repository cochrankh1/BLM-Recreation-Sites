A few years ago I moved out to Oregon with no knowledge of BLM recreation sites and public free camping. That quickly changed when someone introduced me to the idea and educated me on the concept. This opened up endless possibility for traveling throughout the PNW in my van, camping for free in some of the most beautiful public lands I have ever seen. I then found out about all the different phone apps that were developed for camping on public lands. That is what inspired me to create this circle map.

The major functions of this map are the the locations of individual BLM recreation site points indicated by the blue circles. When you hover over an individual sight, it highlights orange. Then when you zoom in on the map to a certain location, the radius size stays the same as you zoom. Also, as you zoom in or out, the scale bar in the top right corner adjusts itself automatically to the new scale. 

I would have liked to add a legend but I just could not figure out how to make the function work for this particular map. Another function I really wanted to make for this map was a marker cluster so as you zoom out, the individual clusters turn into bigger circles indicating where large clusters of BLM sites are vs. where there are few. I would have also like to include a pop up when hovering over individual sites which would include information about each site like coordinates and a brief description. All of these map functions were a little over my head for this project but I look forward to working it into this map in the future. 

I found the data for BLM National Recreation Site Points on data.gov, downloaded the csv file so I could open it in excel and filter the data to just recreation sites in Oregon. When I uploaded the filtered data into geojson.io, I noticed that there were a lot of sites in Washington that were administed by the state of Oregon. When I went back to look at the data in excel, there were no sites admistered by the state of Washington, so I decided to include all of the sites administered by Oregon and create the map for both Oregon and Washington.
